# Unsupervised Learning

This folder contains datasets, notebooks, and project work for Unsupervised Learning techniques, including:

- **K-Means Clustering**  
- **DBSCAN Clustering**  
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**  
- **Basic EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**  

## Datasets

1. **Mall Customers**  
   - [Mall_Customers.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcopeix/cluster-analysis/master/Mall_Customers.csv)  
   - Used for clustering customers based on Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score  

2. **Credit Card Customers**  
   - [Credit_Card_Customers.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/cc_data.csv)  
   - Used for clustering customers based on credit card features  

## Week 1 — Suggested Plan

| Day | Focus | Dataset | Task |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| 1   | EDA + K-Means | Mall Customers | Load dataset, check missing values, summary stats, scatter plots |
| 2   | K-Means | Mall Customers | Cluster customers, visualize clusters, experiment with `k` |
| 3   | PCA | Mall Customers | Reduce dimensions, visualize clusters in 2D |
| 4   | DBSCAN | Mall Customers | Density-based clustering, visualize clusters |
| 5   | EDA + K-Means | Credit Card Customers | Load dataset, basic stats, cluster & visualize |
| 6   | Mini Project | Mall Customers | Combine EDA + K-Means + PCA + DBSCAN, generate insights report |
| 7   | Mini Project | Credit Card Customers | Apply techniques, visualize clusters, summarize insights |
